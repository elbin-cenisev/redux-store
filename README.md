The last assignment of the Fullstack Bootcamp Assignment. Refactor a React app using Context API with Redux.

Author: Elbin Cenisev

## General Notes
This was a very simple assignment. The app (which allows users to buy products from a store by adding them to the cart) was already complete, but it managed global state through Context API. Our assignment involved moving it to React.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS Framework, React, GraphQL, Mongoose, ApolloServer, Redux
